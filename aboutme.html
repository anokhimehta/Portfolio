 <h2> Reflection June 20 (GWC Week 2 Day 2)</h2>
 <p> <i>Based on what you've learned so far, what are some similarities and differences between Scratch and Python?</i><br> So far,
  I've learned many similarities and differences between Scratch and Python. Both have the same concepts: variables, functions, loops, 
  booleans, strings, etc.
  However, they are different in their syntax and there are a few changes here and there in the ways that these concepts work. Python is
  different because we actually have to type out the actual code rather than the drag-and-drop we used in Scratch<br> <br>
  <i>Today, you got to spend time learning how to write and debug your own python programs. How did that feel? What did you like about 
   it? What was hard?</i> <br>
  Learning how to write our own programs in python was interesting and fun because we got to use concepts that we already knew and use 
  them similar to before, but in a different language. It was also interesting to learn how to use the terminal/command line and see 
  the direct outputs of our code. I think it was hard getting used to always having the proper syntax in order for your code to work
  compared to Scratch. Debugging the programs we made was slightly hard at first since I often messed up the syntax, but 
  after getting used to it, it wasn't that bad. Debugging also helped me recognize what kinds of things I should pay attention to when 
  coding in Python.

<p> Recently, we made a side scroller game in Scratch to practice using the coding we learned in GWC. The pictures above show some parts of the game. In my game, the motorbike has to jump over incoming traffic to get points and win.</p>
