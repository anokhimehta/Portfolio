<p>Hi, my name is Anokhi Mehta! I will be a junior at Leland High School in 
the 2017-2018 school year. I am 16 years old and live in Almaden Valley
 with my mom, dad, and younger brother. I made this website as a project for 
<a href="https://www.girlswhocode.com">Girls Who Code</a>, an organization that strives to reduce the gender gap by 
teaching teen girls how to code. </p>

 <h2> Reflection June 20 (GWC Week 2 Day 2)</h2>
 <p> <i>Based on what you've learned so far, what are some similarities and differences between Scratch and Python?</i><br> So far,
  I've learned many similarities and differences between Scratch and Python. Both have the same concepts: variables, functions, loops, 
  booleans, strings, etc.
  However, they are different in their syntax and there are a few changes here and there in the ways that these concepts work. Python is
  different because we actually have to type out the actual code rather than the drag-and-drop we used in Scratch<br> <br>
  <i>Today, you got to spend time learning how to write and debug your own python programs. How did that feel? What did you like about 
   it? What was hard?</i> <br>
  Learning how to write our own programs in python was interesting and fun because we got to use concepts that we already knew and use 
  them similar to before, but in a different language. It was also interesting to learn how to use the terminal/command line and see 
  the direct outputs of our code. I think it was hard getting used to always having the proper syntax in order for your code to work
  compared to Scratch. Debugging the programs we made was slightly hard at first since I often messed up the syntax, but 
  after getting used to it, it wasn't that bad. Debugging also helped me recognize what kinds of things I should pay attention to when 
  coding in Python.
 </p>
 
 <h2> Reflection June 23 (GWC Week 2 Day 5)</h2>
 <p> <i>Today you learned about data structures. Describe what a list is and how it is useful in your own words</i><br> A list is a data
  type that stores any kind of data you want like integers, strings, and decimals. They are useful because you can run through a list and 
  find what you want and generate information about the lists. You can also store all kinds of information in lists and continuously change
  a list.<br><br>
  <i>You worked with a few different partners and in a few different groups today. Which group worked best together? Why?</i><br>
  I think in general, a group works best when everyone is able to contribute ideas and suggestions equally and work collaboratively on a project
  rather than someone doing more work than others.<br><br>
  <i>What did you like the most in python?</i><br>
  My favorite thing so far was the obamicon project because it was really cool to see everything we've learned so far come together in one 
  project and this project is also something similar to what we see in the real world with design. I liked being able to combine my logic/reasoning
  with actual coding to see my projects work.
 </p>
 
 <h2> Reflection June 26 (GWC Week 3 Day 1)</h2>
 <p> Today, we learned the basics of circuits and breadboards as an intorduction to robotics. We were able to use jumper wires, resistors,
  and an LED bulb to create a circuit that lit the bulb. It was interesting to learn about the specific requirements needed to make the
  circuit work and we learned how the flow of a circuit works and needs to be correct. <br><br>
  <i>We talked a lot about robots and their ethics today. How did your idea of robotics change? What makes you excited about the future of
   robotics? Nervous?</i><br>
  I think my general view towards robotics became more appreciative because I was able to learn about robots I didn't know of before 
  and I learned about all the benefits of these creations. I am excited for the future of robotics, especially self-driving cars and in general, 
  the advancements in technology that will make robots more humanistic. I'm not really nervous for the future of robotics<br><br>
  <iYou worked on circuits in groups, and will be working in groups for the rest of the week. What worked well? What could you do better
  next time?</i><br>
  I think it was fun working in groups because we collaboratively came up with possible solutions until we got solutions, but I think we could work
  together better if we sat closer and all four of us were able to work together rather than switching the robot between the two sides of the table.<br>
  
 <h2> Reflection June 29 (GWC Week 3 Day 4)</h2>
 <p> In the last three days, we created several programs to make led bulbs light up in different programs, and programmed an Arduino robot
  to dance and try to escape from any obstacle when it was touched. We worked in groups, wich made the process much more efficient because 
  while two people were coding, the other two were doing the mechanical part directly on the robot. Throughout the process, we continued to
  switch roles so that we each got to experience every part, and it was a very fun porject in general. Here are some pictures and a video 
  from the past few days.</p>

<p> Recently, we made a side scroller game in Scratch to practice using the coding we learned in GWC. The pictures above show some parts of the game. In my game, the motorbike has to jump over incoming traffic to get points and win.</p>
